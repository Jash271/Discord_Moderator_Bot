## Dicord_Moderator_Bot acts as a moderator for your channel,moderating the messages that are being sent on the Channel 👨‍🏫
## The Bot deletes Messages that are toxic in nature and sends nice little DM to the author of that message to follow community Guidelines 
## However on repeated violations of this sort the Bot will kick out the user 
## Additionally there are a few Bot commands that can be executed :

```
$invite
```
### This Command Generates the Server joining Code,so you don't have to go places asking for the invite or search through the list of messages 

```
$Joke

```
### Generates a Random Programming 👨‍💻 Joke to lighten up your Day 


```
$Kick [<id of the user you want to kick >]

```
### Restricted to only a certain level of users who find someone violating the community rules 

```
$Ban [<id of the user you want to Ban>]
```

### This command works Just as the Kick Command,expect this Time Around Bans the User
